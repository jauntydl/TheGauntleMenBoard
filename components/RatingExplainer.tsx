        How the rating works
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        Every ranked player gets a score out of 100. It blends six things, because
        winning alone does not say whether you carried your squad or were carried
        by it.
      </Typography>

        You are scored against the field, not against a target
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        For each of the six, we work out where you sit among everyone else ranked
        this season. Top of the field on a stat is worth 100, bottom is worth 0,
        middle is 50. Those six positions are then blended using the weights above.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        Two consequences worth knowing. A 3.0 K/D and 420 damage per minute cannot
        be added together directly, and any formula that tried would need arbitrary
        numbers invented to make them comparable — comparing positions avoids that
        entirely. But it also means <strong>your rating can move when other people
        play</strong>, even on a day you do not. You are ranked against the field,
        so the field shifting moves you.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h6" component="h2" gutterBottom>
        You need {MIN_MATCHES} matches
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        Below that you appear under Provisional with no rating. A short run of good
        luck should not outrank someone with several hundred matches, and comparing
        you against a field you are not in would not mean anything.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h6" component="h2" gutterBottom>
        Badges are separate
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        The icons beside a name are not part of the rating. Each one marks the
        top {100 - STANDOUT_FLOOR}% of the ranked field on one stat — win rate,
        K/D, kills per match, revives per hour, scoped kills per match or
        automatic kills per match — plus one for flying jets. Hover a badge to see which stat it is and what your figure
        was. Most players hold none, which is what makes the rest worth
        something.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h6" component="h2" gutterBottom>
        What is deliberately not in it
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        <strong>Headshot rate</strong> mostly measures which gun you hold. Snipers
        and DMRs are headshot-or-nothing, so a sniper main posts a high rate by
        playing normally. What they favour is shown as a badge instead, where it
        belongs.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        <strong>Total kills and total score</strong> reward whoever plays the most
        hours. Every part of the rating is a rate for that reason.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        <strong>Finishing position</strong> would be the best input there is — in a
        knockout mode, placing second every time beats alternating first and last.
        The game does report placement figures, but they do not add up: one player
        shows more top-ten finishes than matches played. Rather than rank everyone
        on numbers that cannot be explained, they are left out until they can be.
