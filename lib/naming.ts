/**
 * Which of a player's names the board should show.
 *
 * An EA account has one persona per platform, and the name on the scoreboard
 * in game is the platform one, not the EA ID:
 *
 *   TTVLezWin [ea]  + LezWin [steam]      -> LezWin
 *   dirtymcrae [ea] + Dirty McRae [xbox]  -> Dirty McRae
 *   Exclusiive_9    + Exclusiive [steam]  -> Exclusiive
 *
 * The EA ID is usually built from the platform name, because EA IDs must be
 * globally unique and a plain name is normally taken. Sometimes it contains
 * it outright (LezWin -> TTVLezWin) and sometimes the two only share a stem
 * (flounderpounder -> warFlounder). Either way a long run of characters in
 * common is not a coincidence, and that is the signal this uses.
 *
 * EA lists Steam and Xbox personas but never a PlayStation one — verified
 * against every member of this roster, 19 of whom play on PlayStation and
 * none of whom return a ps persona. So `platform` here means "the platform
 * this name came from", never "the platform they play on": a PlayStation
 * player is indistinguishable from a PC one, which is why the board shows no
 * platform beside the name.
 *
 * A persona that looks nothing like the EA ID is a different identity on a
 * platform they may not even play Battlefield on — SPETZNAZ_HALO also owns
 * "Walmart" on Steam and "Hawkster0828" on Xbox. Guessing between those would
 * put a name on the board that nobody recognises, so an unrelated persona is
 * never chosen and the EA ID stands.
