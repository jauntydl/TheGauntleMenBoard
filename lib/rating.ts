 * alive (K/D), killing at a rate a long match cannot inflate (kills per
 * minute), and score per minute, which is the only counter that picks up the
 * objective play, spotting and support work no other field here sees.
 * Reviving is just under them. Damage stays a token weight because it is
 * already counted once inside the kills it sets up.
 *
 * Kills per minute rather than kills per match: every other rate in the
 * rating is per unit of time, and a Gauntlet match has no fixed length, so
 * per-match rewards whoever survives into long rounds — which win rate
 * already measures. Kills per match keeps its badge; see STANDOUT_TRAITS.
